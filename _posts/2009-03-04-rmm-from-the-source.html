<p>I have to admit that after watching the RMM discussion happen on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rails-business" target="_blank" title="Rails Business Mailing List">rails-business</a> mailing list as well as twitter I was a little skeptical about the idea. But... After watching this idea session from Hashrocket I'm starting to think that its not a bad idea. Especially when Obie mentions that the best practices will get decided based on the number of endorsements for that practice.</p>
<p>Makes sense to me. Watch the video over at Vimeo to see for yourself.</p>
