title: "Fix Rails 3.0 `gem_original_require': no such file to load -- set (LoadError)"

I was assisting aridlous on irc while he was experiencing an issue launching the rails console in a Rails 3.0 beta app. 

He was getting the following error:
{% highlight console %}
$ script/console
/opt/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `gem_original_require': no such file to load -- set (LoadError)
	from /opt/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `require'

{% endhighlight %}

This appears to only affect folks using RVM and Bundler. 

After a little sleuthing it appeared that RVM was setting a blank `GEM_HOME` environment variable when you leave the ruby version set to default. 
{% highlight console %}
$  env | grep GEM_HOME
GEM_HOME=
{% endhighlight %}

There are two easy fixes

1) `unset GEM_HOME`
 or
2) `rvm system`

Both of these clear the `GEM_HOME` environment variable. 

aridlous dug around the bundler src after I helped him out and came back with the following tib-bit. I'd write a patch and probably will but I'm just too tired at the moment. 

>interesting, but the bug seems to be possibly 2 things: empty GEM_HOME should not be used, and when the join occurs I think it is creating an invalid GEM_PATH=":/Users/User/.gem/ruby/1.8:/opt/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8:" ... it should not have that leading ':'
