title: Use MacFUSE to Make a Boxee Torrent Dropbox
---

<p>I recently set up <a target="_blank" href="http://howto.wired.com/wiki/Hack_Your_Apple_TV_With_Boxee">Boxee on my Apple TV</a> and have started using it for all of my media needs. While it’s great at using RSS feeds for torrents, having to SSH in to my Apple TV every time I wanted to start some random video downloading was growing to be a bit of a pain. So I decided to utilize MacFUSE and sshfs to mount a torrent dropbox so that I could just save torrents directly to the dropbox without manually SCP-ing them over to the Apple TV.</p>

<p>First you’ll need to <a target="_blank" href="http://macfuse.googlecode.com/files/MacFUSE-2.0.3%2C2.dmg" title="Download MacFUSE 2.3">install MacFUSE</a> version 2.0 or greater. Once the installation is complete, you will need to get <code>sshfs</code> to actually mount the remote folder to your local box. The easiest way is just to grab it off of SVN by typing the following in the Terminal:</p>

<pre>$ cd ~/Desktop
$ svn co http://macfuse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/filesystems/sshfs/binary sshfs-binaries</pre>

<p>Once you’ve done that, you should copy over the correct binary (either tiger or leopard) to your <code>$PATH</code> somewhere, (I chose <code>/opt/local/bin</code>:</p>

<pre>$ cp sshfs-binaries/sshfs-static-leopard /opt/local/bin/sshfs</pre>

<p>Now you’re ready to actually do the mounting. You will need a point on the filesystem to put the mount, I chose <code>/mnt</code>. We simply need to perform the actual mounting now. Enter this command (assuming that your Apple TV can be SSH-ed into via <code>appletv.local</code>:</p>

<pre>$ mkdir -p /mnt/boxee-torrent-drop
$ sshfs frontrow@appletv.local:/Users/frontrow/Library/Application\ Support/BOXEE/UserData/Torrents /mnt/boxee-torrent-drop</pre>

<p>When prompted for a password enter <code>frontrow</code> (or whatever your SSH password for your Apple TV is) and it should execute without error. If you now browse in the Finder to <code>/mnt</code> you should see a MacFUSE drive icon alias pointing to your Boxee torrents folder. You can drag this mount to your Finder sidebar and whenever you save a torrent just save it to that directory. Boxee will now automatically pick it up and start downloading it!</p>

<p>For bonus points, you could take this and:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Run it as a LoginItem so that you’re always mounted.</li>
  <li>Set up remote SSH access to your Apple TV so that you can start torrents from anywhere in the world (please change your SSH password first).</li>
</ol>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
