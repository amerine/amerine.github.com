I have to admit that after watching the RMM discussion happen on the [rails-business](http://groups.google.com/group/rails-business "Rails Business Mailing List") mailing list as well as twitter I was a little skeptical about the idea. But... After watching this idea session from Hashrocket I'm starting to think that its not a bad idea. Especially when Obie mentions that the best practices will get decided based on the number of endorsements for that practice.

Makes sense to me. Watch the video over at Vimeo to see for yourself.
