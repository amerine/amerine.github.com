title: "Quick Tip: Railsy Array Checks in jQuery"
---

I love the @any?@ and @empty?@ convenience methods that Rails and Ruby provide, they make conditional statements much easier to read. I also really dislike the default method of checking this behavior in jQuery:

<pre name='code' class='js'>if ($('some.element').length > 0) {
  // ...do something
}</pre>

Well, luckily jQuery is ridiculously easy to extend, so why not just mix that functionality in with a couple of quick shot plugin methods? Just add this javascript sometime after you include jQuery:

<pre name='code' class='js'>jQuery.fn.any = function() {
  return (this.length > 0);
}

jQuery.fn.none = function() {
  return (this.length == 0);
}</pre>

That's all you have to do! Now we can make the same call as before, but it looks a little cleaner:

<pre name='code' class='js'>if ($('some.element').any()) {
  // do something more readably...
}</pre>

*UPDATE:* Apologies, I added in the <code>empty</code> bit as a last-second update to the post and forgot to check and realize that <code>empty()</code> is part of jQuery core. Updated the name to <code>none</code> instead.
