title: Open Source Is Amazing
---

Yesterday, I pushed by new, Jekyll-powered blog out to GitHub. That was 24 hours ago. Today, I get a note from Scott Chacon (GitHub guy and overall git guru) saying he liked my template and decided to use it for his site.

That's what's so great about GitHub's open source community: I shared it with no publicity or fanfare on my GitHub account and someone else found it useful and implemented it for their own site. I guess maybe some people don't like others copying their site, I think it's pretty great!

So if you like this little blog and open-source project display page, "fork away":http://github.com/mbleigh/mbleigh.github.com/! All that I would like in return is for you to let me know that you're using it so I can check out your site.
