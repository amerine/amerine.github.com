title: "TwitterAuth Supports 'Sign in with Twitter'"
---

Twitter recently implemented "Sign in with Twitter":http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Sign-in-with-Twitter, a convenience layer on top of their OAuth solution that provides a better user experience for those making use of OAuth as a sign-in strategy for their applications. I have just added support for this new feature to "TwitterAuth":http://mbleigh.com/twitter-auth. This is available immediately to new applications made with TwitterAuth as the default implementation.

If you already have a TwitterAuth application that you would like to utilize the new sign in method all you need to do is add one line to each of your <code>twitter_auth.yml</code> environments:

<pre name='code' class='yaml'>authorize_path: "/oauth/authenticate"</pre>

You don't need to reset any user data or make any other changes, and when you restart your server people should be able to take advantage of the new experience. Enjoy!
