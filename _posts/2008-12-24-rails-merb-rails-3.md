Yesterday it was announced that Merb and rails would merge and be released as Rails 3.0. I never saw this coming, and to be honest I am super happy that it did. I'm glad the the Rails and Merb core teams understand the value of both frameworks, and they can now enhance Rails with the best ideas from Merb.

I'm still going to hole my breath to see how the team members points of view clash or come together... but so far its looking like a great ride.
