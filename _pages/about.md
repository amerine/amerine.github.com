### My Work
These days I'm focused on [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and making it easier for people to ship and operate their software. This is a journey I've been on for years and I hope for many more to come.

Below is a sample of the companies and projects I've worked on.

- [Heroku](https://heroku.com/home)
  - [Private Spaces](https://www.heroku.com/private-spaces) - The private version of Heroku you've always wanted.
  - [Foundation](https://www.heroku.com/platform) - The platform that runs the platform you know and trust.
- [Ruby on Ales](http://ruby.onales.com)
  - I'm lucky enough to run one of the best [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) conferences with my friends [Josh Sullivan](http://dipperstove.com), [Colton Fent](http://colto.github.io/) and [Coby Randquist](http://randquist.us/blog/)
- [AT&T](https://www.att.com)
  - Silver Lining Cloud.
- [LivingSocial](http://livingsocial.com)
  - Merchant Platform team. R&D-heavy Portland crew that built a mobile-focused application platform.
- [G5 ](https://www.getg5.com)
  - Core Team. Built many things, wore many hats.
- [Western Communications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Communications)
  - Built and managed many things here. The Newspaper business is rough.
- [GL Solutions](http://www.glsolutions.com)
  - I owe GL for giving me many of the perspectives I have on the software industry.

### My Failures

Here are the things that I've failed at. These remind me to keep moving forward and learning.
