I"y<p>I just saw a <a href="http://derekneighbors.com/2011/08/ruby-is-just-a-bunch-of-tools/">post</a> in my <a href="http://twitter.com/amerine">tweet stream</a> by Derek Neighbors in which he asserts that todays Rubyists are a “drone army”:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The leaders have disappeared.  The second and third wave are just implementors. They are not idealistic.  The Merb team emerged full of new ideas and a swagger of yesterday but all that died when they merged back into Rails.</p>

  <p>It used to be about changing the world.  Now it’s just about tools.  Workflows are broken and complex.  We fix them with tools instead of ideas.  Regional Ruby talks are littered with talks about tools or non Ruby ideas.  No one is talking about ideals and communities of change.
…
We have become the drone army.  We are losing.
