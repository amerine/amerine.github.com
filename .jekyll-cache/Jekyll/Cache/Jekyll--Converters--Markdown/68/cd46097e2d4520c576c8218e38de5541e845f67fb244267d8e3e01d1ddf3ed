I"¶<p>I have came to the realization tonight that Iâ€™ve failed at working on any of the ideas Iâ€™ve had outside of $work (including blogging here and @ <a href="http://www.counix.com">counix.com</a>). Most of the projects that I have thought about personally have never seen the light of day. Now Iâ€™m sitting here writing this in hopes that I can figure out what the problem is. Is there such thing as â€œpersonal developer blockâ€</p>
