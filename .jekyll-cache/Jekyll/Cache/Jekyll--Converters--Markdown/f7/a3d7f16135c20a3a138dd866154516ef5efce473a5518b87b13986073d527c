I"q<p>I have came to the realization tonight that I’ve failed at working on any of the ideas I’ve had outside of $work (including blogging here and @ <a href="http://www.counix.com">counix.com</a>). Most of the projects that I have thought about personally have never seen the light of day. Now I’m sitting here writing this in hopes that I can figure out what the problem is. Is there such thing as “personal developer block”</p>

<p>At $work I have to balance my main responsibilities (management) and my passions for the things that interest me (rails, ruby, etc…). When I can escape into code at $work its liberating, it frees me from the other duties that in all honesty are not the funnest things in the world. When I spend my time developing, no matter how short… I enjoy it, it brings a smile to my face. I enjoy talking about code. I enjoy brainstorming with my team. I enjoy fixing problems. I enjoy finding new solutions.</p>

<p>So what’s the problem at home? Why can’t I find that same passion for the personal projects that I have burning in the back of my mind? Why do I care about the projects at $work more than the things at home?</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I am constantly hacking.. its just never projects just little chunks of code or routines here and there but nothing seems to evolve into a full blown projects.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; ">Why have I failed?</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">&nbsp;<img width="300" height="188" alt="fail dog" src="http://amerine.net/images/fail.jpg" /></p>

<p>I think I know what’s wrong:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>I need to find the right projects</strong> - With every idea that I tend the think about my mind wanders to the money factor almost immediately. Thats where I fail. I need to focus on projects that I would use and be interested in, not the apps that I “think” someone would be interested in. If I don’t care about the project it will die.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>I need community/teams/mentors</strong> - I’m the type of guy that thrives when I have one or two other people around working with me. I am the most productive when I am pair programming. Without that other person there pushing an driving me things will fall to the wayside. I will miss problems and my designs will suck. Without the right team I can’t function.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>I don’t contribute back enough</strong> - For as much as I depend on FOSS I have barely done anything to help the projects I depend on. No one will learn who I am without giving back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>I’m not good enough</strong> - Over the past year I have absolutely blown at making myself a better developer.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Solutions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I will find projects that interest me until I get out of this funk I need to focus on items that get me excited.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will take a more proactive role in the developer groups around my area… maybe establish a local Ruby Group. I plan on taking a close look at the team at $work and consider some changes to make the environment better. I can’t be a single developer anymore. When the other developer left I fell off track. I plan on sharing my knowledge with the world. Expect to see more posts here talking about things I consider myself to be an expert in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just need to work on FOSS projects. Period. I will begin fixing bugs in Rails, Capistrano &amp; other projects I depend on immediately. I will also begin moving a lot of personal code out to the wild. I plan on becoming an advocate for the projects I depend on, ie <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a>, <a href="http://opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</a> and <a href="http://mysql.com">MySQL</a>. The only way to get more people using them is to show their strengths and being honest about their limitations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I need to broaden my knowledge base. I plan on finishing the stack of books I haven’t touched this year. I plan on getting way better in erlang. I plan on writing a book, handing it to a friend and seeing if I’ve added anything to his life. I plan on getting better organized. I will use a better way to track my tasks than a combination of email, scribbles on small pieces of paper and memory.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Its late, I’m hitting the sack. This post is going to help me, and I’m happy to share it with the world.</p>
