I"¥<p>I enjoy using <a href="http://opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</a> when I can, and Iâ€™ve been using it for a couple small Ruby on Rails deployments. Iâ€™ve received a few questions recently about deploying Ruby on Rails app on <a href="http://opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</a>, so to kill a few â€˜birdsâ€™ with one stone. Iâ€™m throwing this post together so that I can just point them here and let them run with it.</p>
