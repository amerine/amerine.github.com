I"×<p>Yesterday it was announced that Merb and rails would merge and be released as Rails 3.0. I never saw this coming, and to be honest I am super happy that it did. Iâ€™m glad the the Rails and Merb core teams understand the value of both frameworks, and they can now enhance Rails with the best ideas from Merb.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m still going to hole my breath to see how the team members points of view clash or come togetherâ€¦ but so far its looking like a great ride.</p>
